<h3>Steps:</h1>

 - Copy all the functions in your chrome console.

 - Select the root node of the component you want to make a story of

 - Call <code>showcaser($0, false)</code> if you want the story without the 'items' fields or <code>showcaser($0, true)</code> if you want them (could be useful for large data)

You'll probably need to format properly the file and bring some fixes (this script is really far from being perfect)
